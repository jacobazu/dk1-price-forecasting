# DK1 day-ahead price forecasting

Every morning before the noon auction this forecasts tomorrow's hourly day-ahead prices in DK1 (western Denmark). Each forecast is saved, never changed, and scored once the prices are known. It all runs on GitHub Actions.

Dashboard: [jacobazu.github.io/dk1-price-forecasting](https://jacobazu.github.io/dk1-price-forecasting)

## The real test

A backtest shows that a method would have worked. It doesn't show that it works. I made my choices with the backtest period in view, so the backtest is probably a bit too good. The live forecasts are saved before the prices are known, so they can't be adjusted afterwards. That's the interesting part, so the dashboard's main page only shows the live forecasts and their track record. The backtest has its own page.

## Models

- BMT-X: boosting with multiple testing (Kapetanios, Sarafidis & Ventouri), the method from my thesis. One model per hour.
- LEAR-X: one lasso per hour, lambda by BIC (Lago et al. 2021).
- XGBoost-X: boosted trees, one model for all hours.
- Ensemble: the average of the three. This is the forecast.
- Benchmark: the weekly naive (last week's prices on Mon, Sat and Sun, yesterday's on the other days).

The models are re-estimated every day on the last two years.

## Inputs

All known before the noon auction, and the same in the backtest and the live forecast:

- DK1 prices from D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-7
- Neighbour prices from D-1 (DE, DK2, NO2, SE3, SE4)
- Danish holidays
- Weather forecasts made 48 hours ahead for DK1 and Germany (Open-Meteo)

Tried and dropped: Energinet's wind and solar forecasts (published after the auction, so they can't be used) and ENTSO-E load forecasts (no gain). The code for those tests is in the git history.

## Backtest

1 Oct 2025 to 10 Oct 2026, 375 days:

| Model | MAE (€/MWh) | vs naive |
|---|---|---|
| Ensemble | 17.0 | −50% |
| XGBoost-X | 18.1 | −47% |
| BMT-X | 18.2 | −47% |
| LEAR-X | 18.5 | −46% |
| Weekly naive | 34.2 | |

- The ensemble beats each single model (Diebold-Mariano with Newey-West, p < 0.001).
- Weather forecasts for Germany cut the MAE from 19.0 to 17.0 (p < 0.001). Used from the forecast for 14 Oct 2026.
- The forecasts run about 6 €/MWh too low. A bias correction (MAE 17.0 to 16.3, p = 0.02) runs live as a challenger. It replaces the ensemble on 1 Mar 2027 only if its live MAE is lower with p < 0.05.
- Battery revenue at risk: of four methods only EWMA-filtered historical simulation passes the Kupiec, Christoffersen and Acerbi–Székely tests, and only just.

The backtest page has the rest: ranges, the chance of a negative price and the battery backtest.
