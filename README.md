# DK1 day-ahead price forecasting

Every morning before the noon auction this forecasts tomorrow's hourly day-ahead prices in DK1 (western Denmark). Each forecast is saved, never changed, and scored once the prices are known. It all runs on GitHub Actions.

Dashboard: [jacobazu.github.io/dk1-price-forecasting](https://jacobazu.github.io/dk1-price-forecasting)

## The real test

A backtest shows that a method would have worked. It doesn't show that it works. I made my choices with the backtest period in view, so the backtest is probably a bit too good. The live forecasts are saved before the prices are known, so they can't be adjusted afterwards. That's the interesting part, so the dashboard's main page only shows the live forecasts and their track record. The backtest has its own page.

# The forecast

Everything in `scripts/` and `R/`. It only uses data published before the noon auction, and the backtest uses exactly the same inputs.

## Models

Four forecasts are made every morning and compared:

- BMT-X: boosting with multiple testing (Kapetanios, Sarafidis & Ventouri), the method from my thesis. One model per hour.
- LEAR-X: one lasso per hour, lambda by BIC (Lago et al. 2021).
- XGBoost-X: boosted trees, one model for all hours.
- Ensemble: the average of the three. This is the headline forecast.

Benchmark: the weekly naive (last week's prices on Mon, Sat and Sun, yesterday's on the other days). The models are re-estimated every day on the last two years.

## Inputs

The list is in [`inputs.csv`](inputs.csv): what each input is, where it comes from and when it is published. The live forecast and the backtest read the same list of input groups (`R/inputs.R`), and the dashboard won't build if the forecast uses anything that isn't in `inputs.csv` as published before the auction.

| Input | Source | Published |
|---|---|---|
| DK1 prices from D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-7 | Energi Data Service | the day before each day at about 13:00 |
| Neighbour prices from D-1 (DE, DK2, NO2, SE3, SE4) | Energi Data Service | D-2 at about 13:00 |
| Danish holidays | calendar | known in advance |
| Weather forecasts for DK1 and Germany, made 48 hours ahead | Open-Meteo | 48 hours before each hour |

Tried and dropped: Energinet's wind and solar forecasts (published after the auction, so they can't be used) and ENTSO-E load forecasts (no gain). The code for those tests is in the git history.

## Backtest

1 Oct 2025 to 10 Oct 2026, 375 days:

| Model | MAE (€/MWh) | vs naive |
|---|---|---|
| Ensemble | 17.0 | −50% |
| XGBoost-X | 18.1 | −47% |
| BMT-X | 18.2 | −47% |
| LEAR-X | 18.5 | −46% |
| Weekly naive | 34.2 | |

- The ensemble beats each single model (Diebold-Mariano with Newey-West, p < 0.001).
- Weather forecasts for Germany cut the MAE from 19.0 to 17.0 (p < 0.001). Used from the forecast for 14 Oct 2026.
- The forecasts run about 6 €/MWh too low. A bias correction (MAE 17.0 to 16.3, p = 0.02) runs live as a challenger. It replaces the ensemble on 1 Mar 2027 only if its live MAE is lower with p < 0.05.
- Battery revenue at risk: of four methods only EWMA-filtered historical simulation passes the Kupiec, Christoffersen and Acerbi–Székely tests, and only just.

The backtest page has the rest: ranges, the chance of a negative price and the battery backtest.

# Analysis (hindsight, not used by the forecast)

The `analysis` folder uses data that is only known after the auction, like actual generation by type and actual load from ENTSO-E. It is there to understand prices and forecast errors, for example why the forecasts are too low in the evening peak on expensive days. Nothing in it is a forecast input, and no forecast code reads from it. An idea from it can only become an input if a version of the data is published before the auction, a test rule is set before the test, and it runs live as a challenger first.
